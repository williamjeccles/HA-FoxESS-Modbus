<p>The aim of this project is to enable the full use of the Energy dashboard in Home Assistant and is a fully functional replacement of the FoxESS App for reporting needs.</p>

## Manual installation
* Hardware configuration instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/wiki/)
* Create a full backup of your HA instance including the configuration.yaml file
* Copy the contents of the [configuration.yaml](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/blob/main/configuration.yaml) file to your config file
* Create a new file called [modbus.yaml](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/blob/main/modbus.yaml) and place alongside your configuration.yaml file
* Check your config is valid, then Restart HA
* Map energy dashboard as per below example and enjoy configuring dashboards using near realtime data.
